      question: "What is a Certificate of Origin?",
      answer: "A Certificate of Origin (COO) is an official document that declares which country a product was manufactured in. For vehicle imports to Kenya, it verifies where your car was originally made, not just where you bought it from."
    },
    {
      question: "My car is already at Mombasa port without COO. What do I do?",
      answer: "Contact your supplier immediately to obtain the Certificate of Origin retroactively. You'll need to pay penalties ranging from KES 50,000-200,000 depending on vehicle value. Your car may be held at port until documentation is complete, incurring storage fees of KES 5,000-10,000/day."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get a Certificate of Origin from Japan?",
      answer: "For Japanese vehicles, contact the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) or your exporter. They can issue a COO within 3-7 business days. Cost: ~JPY 5,000-10,000 (~KES 4,000-8,000). Most reputable Japanese exporters provide this automatically now."
    },
    {
      question: "Does COO apply to all vehicles or just new ones?",
      answer: "The Certificate of Origin requirement applies to ALL vehicle imports - new and used. Even 8-year-old cars must have a COO showing where they were originally manufactured."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use a Bill of Sale instead of Certificate of Origin?",
      answer: "No, a Bill of Sale only proves purchase. A Certificate of Origin proves manufacturing country. KRA will reject Bill of Sale as a substitute for COO. Both documents are required but serve different purposes."

          <h2>What is a Certificate of Origin?</h2>
          
          <p>
            A Certificate of Origin (COO) is an official document that declares which country a product 
            was manufactured in. For vehicle imports, it verifies where your car was originally made, 
            not just where you purchased it from.

          <h2>Why Did KRA Make This Change?</h2>
          
          <p>According to KRA officials, the Certificate of Origin requirement was implemented to:</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Combat Tax Evasion:</strong> Some importers were misrepresenting vehicle origin to claim false duty exemptions</li>
            <li><strong>Align with EAC Standards:</strong> East African Community trade agreements require COO for all goods</li>
            <li><strong>Track Import Sources:</strong> Better data on where Kenya's vehicles are coming from</li>
            <li><strong>Verify Authenticity:</strong> Reduce import of stolen or illegally exported vehicles</li>
